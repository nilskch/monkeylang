# Monkeylang

This is a Rust implementation of the Monkey programming language created by [Thorsten Ball](https://github.com/mrnugget).
This is a fun learning project to understand more about interpreters and compilers and to learn Rust.

## Playground
I created a wasm based playground for the Monkey language. Test it out [here](https://google.com).

## CLI
You can use the monkey CLI to run monkey code locally. You can install it using cargo.
